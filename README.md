Notes:
- for better performance right click [here](https://github.com/yokrysty/krysty-xbmc/raw/master/advancedsettings.xml), click 'Save link as' (Google Chrome) or 'Save Linked Content As' (Opera), save the file anywhere, then move the file to userdata folder of XBMC/Kodi.
- if there are any problems installing from the repository, shut down XBMC/Kodi and remove the Addons#.db file (where # is a number) from the userdata -> Database folder of XBMC/Kodi.

Kodi userdata folder path:
- Windows:    Right Click on Start -> Run -> type %APPDATA%\Kodi\userdata -> press Enter
- Android:    /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/userdata/
- iOS:        /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/Kodi/userdata/
- Linux:      ~/.kodi/userdata/
- Mac(1):     /Users/your_user_name/Library/Application Support/Kodi/userdata/
- OpenELEC:   /storage/.kodi/userdata/Database/

(1)By default, Mac OS X 10.7 hides the user's Library folder, which is where Kodi's userdata folder and logs are stored. To permanently reveal the ~/Library folder, open up Terminal and run this command: <code>chflags nohidden ~/Library</code>. Note: Anytime there is an OS X update (e.g. from version 10.7.3 to 10.7.4) you will have to run this command again as the folder will be hidden again.
<br />

Kodi log file path:
- Android:     /sdcard/Android/data/org.xbmc.kodi/files/.kodi/temp/kodi.log
- iOS/ATV2:    /private/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/kodi.log
- Linux:   	   $HOME/.kodi/temp/kodi.log
- Mac OS X:	   /Users/your_user_name/Library/Logs/kodi.log
- Windows:	   %APPDATA%\Kodi\kodi.log
